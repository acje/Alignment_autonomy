# Pareto efficient autonomy and alignment

Made with https://draw.io

Note: In version 2 of the model I have loosened the coupling between Pioneers, Settlers, Town Planners and the management paradigms.

# The story behind the model

Stephen Bungay in his book "The Art of Action: How Leaders Close the Gaps between Plans, Actions and Results", claims that alignment and autonomy are (at least somewhat) independent. That is, you can have some of both, and it isn't always a tradeoff. This made me think of Andrew Clay Shafer and his claim that we are operating in Pareto Inefficient Nash Equilibriums. This model doesn't try to identify or explain those Nash Equilibriums, however the pareto inefficiency in relation to some command structures are shown.

Simon Wardley talks about "the system of theft" between Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners, and it struck me that alignment and autonomy might help expand the model, although he talks about different concepts; agile, lean, six-sigma. My thought was that these must be related to alignment and autonomy.

The two axis and their labels together with the placement of the concepts "Command and control" and "Mission command" is largely taken from Stephen Bungay.

The line labeled "Pareto efficient autonomy and alignment" and the labels "inefficient" and "Unmanaged" are my contribution to the model.

The labels "Pioneer", "Settlers" and "Town planners" are taken from Simon Wardley.

The goal, or conclusion, is to bridge the models of Stephen Bungay and Simon Wardley, adding dependency between the axis to the mix.

Things I'm not happy about:
- The venn-diagram component doesn't feel right. But dropping it makes the model less clear as it stands now.
